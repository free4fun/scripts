This repository contains a curated collection of Bash scripts for various automation and productivity tasks.  
Each script resides in its own subfolder, accompanied by a dedicated `README.md` that explains its usage, configuration, and purpose.

## Structure

- Each subdirectory represents a single Bash script or a related set of scripts.
- Every subfolder includes:
  - The script file(s)
  - A `README.md` with usage instructions and details
